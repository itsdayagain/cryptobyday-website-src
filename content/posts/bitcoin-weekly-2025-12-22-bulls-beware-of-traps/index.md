title = 'Bitcoin weekly: Bulls, beware of traps'
summary = '''With stock markets strong, there is still room for bitcoin to bounce. Nothing has changed in the chart though, and the message remains the same: watch out for any rally to turn into a bull trap.'''

On Thursday, CPI inflation in the US came in at 2.7%, much lower than the
expected 3.1%. This perked stock markets back up, with the S&P 500 closing the
week near all time highs. Like last week, the simple conclusion here is that
stock markets remain strong, with no signs of a top being in just yet.

Bitcoin closed the week flat, the battle between permabulls and bears still
ongoing. Judging by the narrative on social media, it seems more people are
coming around to the idea that 2026 is going to be a bear market year in crypto.

However, what people in the news and on social media are saying should be
regarded as mostly noise. In this analysis we focus on the charts, because the
charts are the windows into what is actually happening in the market. And in the
chart, the picture remains the same here: bitcoin is still consolidating after
the breakdown five weeks ago.

Any bounce should be expected to be sold into, with major technical resistances
at $100k and $109k. To the downside, a continuation to a lower low can find
support at $72k-76k.

Starting this week, I will stop covering the bitcoin dominance chart in these
weekly updates. My view on the bitcoin dominance has changed, and I no longer
believe the concept of broad altseasons to be useful from a practical
perspective. I will write more about this in a separate article.

That's it for this week. Stay sharp, and Merry Christmas everybody!
