## Product

Decentralized CDN. Node runners get paid $PIPE for running nodes in the network,
storing and serving content. No special hardware, runs on any VM.

Price right now is $1 per TB bandwith, $10 per TB/month storage. This is less
than 1/10 the cost of Amazon AWS.

By running nodes more locally, they can achieve lower latency than Cloudflare
etc.

## Token

Token $PIPE. Used to pay for bandwith. Burnt somehow.

## Team

Mostly ex-AWS. Seems good. I listened to a couple of interviews with David
Rhodus, their founder. Good vibe.

Backed by Multicoin Capital, Solana Ventures. Lists Anatoly Yakovenko and
Avery Ching as "Angel Partners".
