## TL;DR

- Altcoins are not dead, but the concept of a broad altseason is
- Forget about bitcoin dominance
- Instead, identify key narratives and specific coins

## The four year cycle theory

The concept of the four year crypto cycle, ending in a broad so called altseason, 
has been very popular among crypto analysts, myself included. And for good
reason. Looking back to the past two cycles, topping in 2017, and 2021
respectively, the pattern has been strikingly similar: after bottoming out about
a year after the previous top, bitcoin moved first, then altcoins followed,
eventually leading to an across-the-board parabolic altcoin orgy into the end of
the cycle.

This broad and indiscriminate altcoin rally in year four of the cycle is what
the term "altseason" refers to. And this altseason is what many of us in the
space have been patiently waiting for, desperately repeating the mantra
"altseason is coming" to numb the silent dispair of our underwater altcoin bags
weighing heavy around our necks.

## Altseason is dead

But alas, while it might be that bitcoin has once again played out its four year
prophecy, altseason clearly has not. The faithful have been waiting in vain, and
it's now painfully clear that for all practical purposes, the concept of the
broad altseason is dead.

A short review of the past three years should make it obvious that a different
strategy is needed. Looking back, the concept of altseason, especially as viewed
through the lens of bitcoin dominance, has not helped at all. We never got a
broad altseason this cycle, and if you were sitting around waiting for it, you
in fact missed many fantastic opportunities.

## Long live altcoins

Because despite the lack of a broad altcoin season, there were multiple specific
narratives that did extremely well over the past three years. For example Solana
and a few new L1s, a number of DePIN projects, some gaming coins, AI, and of
course: memecoins. This all with bitcoin dominance on a steady upward march,
showing that on a whole, altseason was nowhere to be found.

And of course, thinking about it, this shouldn't come as too much of a suprise.
As the total crypto market grows, it naturally becomes more segregated: some
sectors can thrive, while others languish. Thus, altseason is dead, but altcoins
are not.

## Adapt or die

So if this is the new reality, how to we deal with it? As investors in the
space, what changes do we need to make to our strategy?

I think there are three main takeaways here:

1. Altcoins are not dead, but the concept of a broad altseason is
2. Monitor bitcoin dominance, but do not base your strategy on it
3. Instead, identify key narratives and specific projects 

So in short, we should get more specific: we should care less about what bitcoin
is doing, and also less about what the crypto market as a whole is doing.
Instead we should put our energy into thinking about upcoming narratives, and
research individual projects that can play into those narratives.

That's how we win going into 2026 and beyond.

## The 2026 gameplan

I'm not going to dive into specific narratives and altcoins here, that wasn't
the point of this article. 

But just shortly, right now the only narrative showing positive charts is
privacy. Primarily Monero and Zcash, possibly with Midnight as a new kid on
the block.

In addition to privacy, my current gameplan for 2026 is to focus on DePINs, web3
gaming, stablecoins, and RWAs. But more on this later.

Stay tuned.
