In tradfi, stock markets across the world had a good week and overall everything
looks great. In the US, both the S&P500 and the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100
closed at new all time highs. There is simply nothing bearish about tradfi right
now. Which is exactly where we want it to be for crypto to do well.

Turning to bitcoin. After breaking out two weeks ago, it has now spent two weeks
consolidating in a narrow range between about $116k and $120k. On Friday, The
capital management firm Galaxy Digital announced that they had successfully
completed the selling of over 80,000 BTC on the behalf of an early bitcoin
whale. Part of this sale was likely what caused the dip on early Friday morning.

The fact that the market could absorb an enormous sale like this and still not
move down much is a very good sign. Purely looking at the bitcoin chart, it
tells the same story: very much still bullish, with a conservative price target
of $142k.

In the altcoin space, this week we saw a pullback across the board. So far this
looks like a healthy correction, with nothing yet to suggest that the recent
altcoin rally has peaked.

In summary, the view remains that this bull market is far from over. Letâ€™s see
what the next week brings!
