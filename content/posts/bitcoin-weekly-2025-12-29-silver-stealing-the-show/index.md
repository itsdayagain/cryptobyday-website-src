Last week was Christmas, and not much happened in the markets. Except for the
silver market, that is, which has now clearly entered a parabolic phase.

Everyone across my timeline is suddenly talking about silver, with various
"fundamental" reasons to explain why it will only keep going up. If you've been
in the crypto space for a while, this type of price action, together with this
type of sentiment, should be very familiar to you. And it should set off big
flashing warning signs, as you know it can only end in one way: a blow-off top.

Turning to crypto, on my timeline I also see various people confidently
proclaiming that profits from silver is now going to flow into bitcoin, kicking
off a grand bitcoin rally to new all time highs and beyond.

I think that's delusional.

In fact, nothing has changed in the outlook for bitcoin, which spent another
week flat. It's not a good sign that crypto has remained so weak while stocks
and precious metals have been putting in new all time highs. However, there is
still chance for a bitcoin relief rally here, especially as sentiment is turning
more and more bearish. But if so, I think it's going to have to happen soon.

Technically, in the bitcoin chart, resistance is still at $100k and $109k. Long
term support is still at $72-76k. On the daily chart, a rectangle is forming,
between $94k to the upside, and $84.4k to the downside. A break above $94k could
take price back up to $100k, while a break below $84.4 could take it down to
$72-76k.

And with that, the final update for the year comes to an end. Happy New Year!
And may your 2026 be filled with success.
