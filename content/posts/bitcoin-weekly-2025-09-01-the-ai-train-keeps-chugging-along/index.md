In tradfi, the big thing this week was the NVIDIA earnings report that came in
on Wednesday. They didn’t smash it out of the ballpark with this one, which
disappointed the markets a bit. But big picture the numbers were good; the
demand for chips is still strong, as the tech overlords keep building out data
centers to feed their LLM beasts. As I’ve said before, at some point the AI
train is going to run off the tracks and crash. But for now it’s still on,
chugging along just fine.

Zooming out a little, the issue of inflation and Fed rate cuts is still very
much front and center. Markets have been in somewhat of a stand-by mode over the
past couple of weeks, waiting for clarity. A rate cut at the September 17
meeting seems very likely; right now the market has it at 90% probability. But
the impact of tariffs on the economy and prices is still not clear, and the
markets are left waiting for more signs before they decide which way to go.

This has also been reflected in bitcoin, which by now has spent 7 weeks
consolidating after the breakout in early July. The bitcoin chart this week is
more interesting than usual though, as it has come right down to test the 109k
breakout level. Going back to test the level of a breakout like this is not
uncommon, and it’s usually the logical place to buy the dip. So let's see if it
can find support here and bounce.

The BTC price target of 142k still remains. Price has to fall down below 100k
before the breakout pattern (and price target) is invalidated. And so far we’re
nowhere near that level. That said, the chart will look better if we bounce
here.

Looking to the bitcoin dominance, there is no change since last week. It’s still
heading down, meaning altseason is still on.

All in all, there is no reason for concern yet. Let’s see what the coming week brings!
