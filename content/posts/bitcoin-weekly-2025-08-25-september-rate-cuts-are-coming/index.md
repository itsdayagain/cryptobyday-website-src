Last week, markets were mostly in standby up until Friday, anxiously waiting for
Powell to spill the beans about the prospects of a September rate cut at his
Friday speech in Jackson Hole.

Then Friday came. Powell spoke. The markets listened. And apparently they were
happy with what they heard: rate cuts are still on the table. Stocks pumped.
Bitcoin pumped. Both Ethereum and BNB put in new all time highs.

After the Friday pump, bitcoin gave back some gains over the weekend, and closed
in one more week of consolidation after the breakout in early July. In other
words: nothing has changed. The price target of $142k remains. Note that this is
a conservative price target; it might well end up going a lot higher.

Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance kept dropping. Meaning the big altseason is still
in play. At some point during the next couple of months, dominance will likely
bounce. This could be because the whole market corrects, or because bitcoin sets
off on its next leg up while Ethereum consolidates.

Looking at the daily chart, 55.5% could be where dominance finds support. But
that’s mostly speculation. As always we’ll have to keep watching the charts week
by week and take things as they come.

In summary, let’s see how the coming week plays out, but for now everything
still looks good!
