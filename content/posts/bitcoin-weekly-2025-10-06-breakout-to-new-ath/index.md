The week before last, the sentiment was awful all around the cryptosphere, as
bitcoin et al all sold off heavily, liquidating traders to the tune of billions
of dollars. My take in last week's update was that it was an over-reaction
though, and I had this to say:

> These two facts make this dump look like a temporary correction, caused by
market makers flushing out leveraged positions.  > > If this assessment is
correct, crypto markets should turn up again within the next couple of weeks. So
let's keep watching.

And yes, that turned out to be the correct take: after rallying throughout the
week, bitcoin put in a new ATH on Sunday morning, and then ended up closing the
week at $123.5k, a new weekly high. Ideally I would have wanted it to close a
liiittle higher. But there is no reason to doubt bitcoin's strength here.

There is of course still the slight chance that this breakout will turn out to
be a fake-out, leading to a new dump. But this is very much not the main
scenario right now. Bitcoin breaking out into new highs is extremely bullish.
Period. It can now continue towards the price target of $142k. Remember that I
first set this target all the way back on July 13th, and I have maintained it
every single week since then.

Also note that all along I've said that this is a *conservative* price target.
Bitcoin will likely end up going even higher before this cycle is over.

Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance continued to bounce. But the trend is still clearly
down, meaning altseason is still ongoing. If history repeats, BTC will now keep
going up, followed by a continuation of the big cap alts like ETH, SOL, and BNB.
Then the smaller cap alts will get their time to shine, towards the end of
altseason, leading up to the cycle top.

LFG!
