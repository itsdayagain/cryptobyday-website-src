What a few weeks it's been in the crypto market. A fakeout to the downside in
late September was then followed by a week of rallying, culminating in a new
bitcoin all time high last Monday. Everything looked good.

Until Friday afternoon.

That's when the largest liquidation event in crypto history started. Seemingly
triggered by news of a deepening trade conflict between the US and China, crypto
started selling off along tradfi stocks. But unlike in stocks, where the dip was
relatively mild, in crypto it escalated into the largest wipeout that has ever
taken place in the entire history of crypto.

On Binance, the largest crypto exchange, USDT pairs of many multi-billion dollar
altcoins wicked down 70-80% or even more, as altcoin traders got completely
annihilated across the board.

This bloodbath has 100 meter tall neon signs flashing MARKET MANIPULATION all
over it. This had nothing to do with China tariffs. That was just the trigger
for deep-pocketed insiders to set off a cascade of liquidations. My guess is
that it was several independent actors taking advantage of the situation. But in
any event, a few people got a whole lot richer, while thousands of holders and
traders got a whole lot poorer, as they were liquidated or sold in fear.

This event will be remembered in crypto history. But exactly how it will be
remembered is still not clear. It could be the start of a downturn, or it could
turn into a small blip in an ongoing bull market.

My guess is a small blip. Let's have a look at what the charts say.

Despite the chaos, BTC held up relatively well. On some exchanges it dipped all
the way down to $100k. But in the end it recovered, and the week closed Sunday
night at $115k. Well above the $109k support level that has held since the
breakout back in early July.

This means the inverse head and shoulders breakout is still in play, and the
price target at $142k remains. As dramatic as Friday was, the bitcoin chart
still holds up.

As altcoins were crushed on Friday, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) saw a sharp spike
all the way up to 63.5%. However, it then quickly pulled back and closed the
week at 59.5%, below the 40 week ema. This means the downtrend is intact, and
altseason is still on.

So yes, for now, it looks to me like this bull market will continue.
