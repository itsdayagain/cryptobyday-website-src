And so September 17 finally came. The day of the long awaited rate cuts from the
US Federal Reserve. All eyes were on the announcement from the Fed, and on
chairman Powell’s subsequent press conference.

As expected, the Fed decided to cut 25 basis points, bringing the target rate
down from 4.25-4.50% to 4.0-4.25%. On the press conference, Powell explained how
in their view the risk factors have balanced over the past 6 months. From
inflation being the overwhelming risk, to a weakening jobs market and higher
unemployment now also becoming a concern. In the Fed’s view, this warrants a
rate cut, and also most likely more cuts going forward, but as always the data
will lead the way.

The US stock markets overall reacted positively to the news, closing the week at
all time highs. The big indices look very strong, with no signs of a top being
in.

On the crypto side, bitcoin has been lagging a behind, still working on breaking
through resistance around 117k. But big picture the chart still looks good, and
it’s likely only a matter of time before it breaks through, and moves on to new
all time highs, possibly some time in October. The price target on the weekly
chart remains at 142k.

As of writing this Monday morning, bitcoin is dipping down to $112k, on big
liquidations across all the entire crypto market. As far as I can tell right
now, this is leverage being flushed out. It's only Monday so far, and a lot can
happen until the week ends on Sunday, so let's wait and see.

Looking to the bitcoin dominance chart, the drop has leveled off over the past
couple of weeks. But there are still no signs of a bottom being in. So for now,
altseason is still on.

That's it for this week. I'll be back again next Monday with a new update.
Thanks for reading!
