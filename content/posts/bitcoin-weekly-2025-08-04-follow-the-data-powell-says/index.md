In tradfi, last week stock markets had a good start of the week. Then came
Wednesday, and the US Fed announced that there would be no July rate cut. This
was no surprise at all, and the markets didn’t react much. What they did react
to was the following press conference, where chairman Powell refused to give any
promises of a September cut. This should have come as no surprise either, as
Powell has repeated over and over and again and again that they will always
follow the data. But still, the markets were apparently somewhat disappointed,
and sold off a little.

However, the bigger sell off came on Thursday and Friday, as Trump announced a
new barrage of tariffs that got everybody spooked, and as job number revisions
came in much larger than expected. If we take a step back and look at the bigger
picture though, so far this pull back is not large, and it could well turn into
a normal correction in a strong uptrend.

Turning to bitcoin, despite following the rest of the market down, it closed the
week at $114k, still sitting well above the breakout point at $109k. The
breakout has not been invalidated, and the conservative price target remains at
$142k. So with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.

Let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s news
about tariffs and jobs. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems
the most rational.
