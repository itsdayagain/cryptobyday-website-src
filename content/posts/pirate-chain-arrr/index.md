"summary": "Pirate Chain is a fork of Zcash. But unlike Zcash, it forces all transactions to be shielded. It also writes snapshot checkpoints to Litecoin, effectively making it as secure against 51% attacks as Litecoin itself is. Pirate Chain is a real grassroots OG layer 1, that won't be able to compete with the bigger players. Nevertheless, it could rise along with the privacy narrative going into 2026."

- OG grassroots privacy coin.

## Product

Privacy coin. Originally a fork of Zcash, running as a chain in the Komodo
system. But unlike Zcash, only shielded transactions are allowed. Also has added
a Delayed Proof of Work "dPoW" mechanism, whereby a snapshot is saved to
Litecoin via Komodo, every 10 blocks.

Two things are on the roadmap for 2026:

- A new cross-platform lite wallet.
- "Orchard" upgrade.

Orchard is a big upgrade to the system, removing the trusted setup. There will
also be a new address format. The Orchard code is originally from the Zcash
upgrade with the same name, and Pirate Chain has been working on porting it to
their chain at least since early 2024.

## Token

L1 token. Reward per block, like Bitcoin. Total supply 200 million. More
aggressive release schedule than bitcoin.

## Team

The team is all anon.

## Community

100% organic grassroots community. Still alive, but not very large.

Blog with monthly updates. Community calls every Sunday, plus a monthly update
once a month. There is a weekly team meeting in the Discord, but not for public
access.
