# A website about how to invest in crypto

Hello there. My name is Day, and I invite you to follow along as I develop and
explain a complete system for how to invest in crypto.

I've been doing crypto for more than 10 years by now, and through the years I
have made every mistake in the book. On this website, I will use what I've
learnt and explain how to invest in crypto from scratch, to help you decide what
to buy, when to buy, and when to sell. Hopefully making your ride a little
smoother than mine.

So please enjoy, and good luck on your crypto journey!

Please note that NOTHING on this website is financial advice. You are 100%
responsible for your own decisions.

## A note on generative AI

All content on this site is made by me, with zero use of generative AI. In fact,
I don't use gen AI whatsoever in any part of my process.

This is not because of some ideological refusal to bend the knee to the AI
overlords. It's simply because I haven't found a helpful way of using gen AI in
my process. For me, writing is thinking, and the use of AI to outsource this
would defeat the purpose, and lead to worse results. Not only content-wise, but
also for my growth as a human being.

This might change in the future. But for now, this site and all its content is
100% Day, 0% AI.
